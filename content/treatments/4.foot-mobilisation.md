Foot Mobilisation Therapy is a non-surgical way to optimise joint functioning and ensure pain-free motion.
It is a highly effective and specialised treatment, which focuses on assessing and treating joints and muscles in the
feet, ankles, and legs to release areas of joint restriction.

Our clinical staff will identify the specific cause of your foot pain and use gentle mobilisation techniques to improve
the normal range of motion.
This treatment is often combined with orthosis to maintain normal foot function and myofascial manipulation to release
and restore normal muscle, tendon, and fascial function.

The practice of [FMT](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628384/) has been thoroughly researched as an effective
treatment programme and also certified by The Royal College of Podiatry.
