Steroid injections, also called corticosteroid injections, 
are anti-inflammatory medicines used to treat a range of conditions.

They can be used to treat problems such as [joint pain](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/joint-pain/),
[arthritis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/arthritis/), nerve pathology, 
and some soft tissue lesions such as bursitis and plantar fascial pains.

Steroid injections are only given by a registered healthcare professionals.
Common examples include [hydrocortisone](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/hydrocortisone-injections/), triamcinolone, 
and methylprednisolone.

Steroids closely copy the effects of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands, 
two small glands found above the kidneys. When injected into a joint or muscle, 
steroids reduce redness and swelling (inflammation) in the nearby area. 
This can help relieve pain and stiffness.

At Chase Podiatry, 
our clinical staff are trained to give steroid injections and often will use ultrasound to guide the injection to the 
correct site.
