Introducing our Podiatry Assistant Practitioner Georgina, who will be providing medical toenail care clinics from the beginning of October 2021. These are clinics for people who need basic nail care, which they are unable to do themselves. 

All patients will need to be assessed by a Registered Podiatrist to ensure they have no medical risk before being transferred into this clinic. New patients will need to attend for a 30-minute assessment appointment.

For full details on our current prices, please see our [price list]({% link _pages/about/treatment-plans.md %}).
