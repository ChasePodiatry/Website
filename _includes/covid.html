        COVID-19 Patient Statement
        <small>Updated: 21st July 2020</small>
    </h1>
    <p>
        Our governing body, The College of Podiatry, has now advised that we are able to see any patients that require
        an appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do have a number of measures in place to protect both our staff and patients. You will be advised of these
        when you ring to book an appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please do not attend for your appointment if you show any symptoms of COVID-19 i.e. new persistent cough, high
        temperature, loss of taste and smell.
    </p>
    <p>
        We look forward to welcoming you all back to the practice.
    </p>
