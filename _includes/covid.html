    <h1>COVID-19 Patient Statement</h1>
    <p>
        We continue to remain open and providing our services, but our main priority is keeping our team and clients
        safe and healthy. We have high standards of hygiene as a matter of course, but will be taking increased measures
        to make our clinics as clean and safe as we possibly can.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please do not attend the practice if you have the key symptoms for possible infection of Corona Virus. These are
        a high temperature and / or a new continuous cough. If you are in a household where someone else has symptoms,
        again you should self isolate and postpone your appointment for 14 days.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are unable to attend because you need to self- isolate, or are in one of the identified at risk groups,
        please ring to cancel your appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides our high standards of hygiene, we are taking a few extra precautions to help prevent spreading of the
        virus. When you attend the practice, we will give you a squirt of hand gel to sanitise your hands. If somebody
        is accompanying you, it would be better for them to wait in the car wherever possible, unless they are also a
        patient with an appointment. Could you please turn up just a couple of minutes before your appointment. We are
        just trying to limit the number of people in the waiting area. We are also working on spreading out our
        appointments so that there are slightly longer intervals between patients.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are also offering home visits as an alternative for those people unable to attend. As health care
        professionals, the guidelines still allow us to visit patients in their own homes. We would have to assess the
        visit on the day of the appointment, to make sure it is a safe environment for our staff to attend. We are
        offering our visits at a reduced price to our normal fee, at Â£30.
    </p>
    <p>
        From all of us here at Chase Podiatry, we sincerely hope you do stay well and look forward to seeing you all
        again in the not too distant future.
    </p>
