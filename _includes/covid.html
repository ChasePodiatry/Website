        COVID-19 Patient Statement
        <small>Updated: 24th March 2020</small>
    </h1>
    <p>
        As a medical facility, we are able to continue to offer our service. However, we must ask that you really
        consider whether it is essential that you come in for your appointment. For the majority of people, a foot
        problem can wait.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the next 3 weeks, we will be offering a reduced service for essential care only. We will be contacting all
        of our patients to assess whether they really need to be seen, if they havenâ€™t already made the decision to
        cancel. If somebody does need to come in for care, we will have extended appointment slots to limit contact with
        other patients in our waiting area. We would ask that you come into the practice alone wherever possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our position remains subject to advice from the Government and our governing body, The College of Podiatry.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will review this situation and be back in touch with our patients as and when anything changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        We hope you all stay safe and well.
