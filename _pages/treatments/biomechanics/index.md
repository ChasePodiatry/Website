Podiatric biomechanics involves not only the assessment of the structure, alignment and function of the feet and legs but also the whole body. The foot is part of the complex systems of the body and is completely unique to allow us to walk upright. 
Through a series of complex joints and muscle function it has adapted to walk on almost any surface from rough uneven ground to flat hard smooth surfaces. However, this hard flat surface causes a low grade repetitive movement that subjects the body to many forces that cause injury.

The average person takes an average of 10,000 steps a day with forces acting on the foot of up to twice the body weight. The majority of patients have a low arched (pronated) foot type and combined with muscle imbalance, activity levels and footwear can all lead to pain and injury.

The use of specifically designed and personally moulded insoles (orthoses) can help to control the way in which we function. However, training programme, footwear modification, muscle function and balance (strength/flexibility) may also need to be modified to help improve function.

This section outlines the process to biomechanical evaluation and gait analysis with specific conditions and treatment options.

## Gait Analysis
Do you know the answer to these few simple questions?

* As you start increasing your mileage - are you at risk of injury?
* Are you performing the right exercises to maximise your foot function?
* Do your shoes provide the right support?
* When did you last change or have your shoes checked?

Every year, many runners have to defer their participation in an event due to injuries sustained in the last couple of months of training.

An assessment at Chase Podiatry may identify problems before you develop an injury.

In conjunction with a detailed assessment of your underlying structure (biomechanics), we perform an analysis of your programme.

### Video analysis

Video analysis of gait is available at Chase Podiatry in The Burntwood Health Hub.

The cost of video analysis is free as part of an orthosis package but as a separate analysis is chargeable at Â£100.

### In-shoe pressure analysis

In-shoe pressure analysis can be arranged by referral to a local university specialist department.

## Orthosis (orthotics)
Orthosis, also referred to as orthotics or insoles, are custom made insoles designed to be warn inside the shoe during normal daily activity.
As part of your appointment we will explain why the orthosis are required and what benefits you can expect from them.
We will show you what the devices will look like, and discuss which material will work best for you.
Finally, we will look at your shoes to make sure that the orthosis will fit, and advise you if a change in shoe might give you the best results.
If everything looks good, we will make an impression of your foot so we can make a cast to form the orthosis on.

From this point it will usually take two to three weeks for us to make your orthosis.
It can often take up to six weeks to adjust the foot function and feel comfortable, orthosis are a long term solution not a quick fix. 
You should commence wearing for an hour or so a day and gradually increase until you can wear them all day. 
We may need minor adjustments to make them fit perfectly, you simply need to bring them back and we will see what needs to happen.

You may also notice a number of things which are usually temporary:

* You might notice a lump under the arch of your foot. Unfortunately this is unavoidable but as long as it does not feel so large as to cause excessive discomfort then you will get used to it until you no longer notice it.
* You might feel like your heel is raised and that you are coming out of the heel of your shoe as you walk. This is because your foot does not flatten and turn out quite so much as you walk. This causes the heel to come off the ground slightly earlier with each step which can feel as if your heel is loose in your shoe. After a few weeks your calf muscles and other tissues adjust causing this to go away. This is the reason you may have had advice on calf stretching exercises.

These devices will usually last up to a few years before they need to be replaced depending upon the usage. 
We guarantee wear and tear on standard orthosis for twelve months, but sports orthosis that are used for marathon or long distance running can only be guaranteed for six months due to increased wear. 
If you have a problem or need replacement devices then please contact us for a review.

We will give you your casts for you to keep, reducing the cost of further orthosis. 

### Orthosis prices
The cost of your orthosis is listed on our [price list]({% link _pages/about/treatment-plans.md %}), and this includes:
* Your initial appointment
* A biomechanical assessment
* Casting
* A fitting appointment
* Any alternations
* A 6 week review appointment
* An anual review if required

Where necessary, we may also include one foot mobilisation or one fascial manipulation treatment, however any additional treatments will be charged seperately.

### Refunds
Chase Podiatry & Chiropody are proud to be one of only a few practices to offer a refund if you feel your orthosis have had no benefit at all.
All we ask is that you allow us to make all necessary adjustments and explore all treatment options, and that you follow our footwear advice.

Your will be refunded for the cost of your orthosis. 
However we cannot refund the initial consultation or the biochemical assessment, the cost of which will vary depending on your clinician.
A breakdown of these prices is available on our [price list]({% link _pages/about/treatment-plans.md %}).

All refunds will be reviewed by one of our clinical directors, and all casts and devices will need to be returned to the practice.
