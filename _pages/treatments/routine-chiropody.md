## Corns and Calluses
Feet corns and callus can be extremely painful and are caused by the thickening of the skin on the foot that becomes painful. 
They are caused by excessive pressure or friction (rubbing) on the skin.

Feet corns and calluses can be painlessly removed and advice can be given to prevent further recurrences.

A corn is a small area of skin which has become thickened due to pressure on it, they are often very painful. A corn is normally round in shape and presses into the deeper layers of the skin. There are two types of corns, hard and soft. Hard corns form on the tops of the toes or over any bony areas. Soft corns form in between the toes and are equally painful.
Callus tends to be larger, broader and has less defined edge than a corn. They commonly form on the underside of the foot and over bony areas.

### Common corn/ callus causes

* Abnormal walking patterns
* Tight or poor fitting shoes.
* Deformities of the feet such as hammer or claw toes, which lead to the skin rubbing more easily inside shoes.
* Excessive running or walking

The practice staff are currently being trained to provide alcohol injections (Ref Dockery) which have been shown to significantly reduce or clear corns.
